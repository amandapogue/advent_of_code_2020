    "Before you leave, the Elves in accounting just need you to fix your expense report (your puzzle input); apparently, something isn't quite adding up. Specifically, they need you to find the two entries that sum to 2020 and then multiply those two numbers together.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:\n",
    "|1721|\n",
    "|979|\n",
    "|366|\n",
    "|299|\n",
    "|675|\n",
    "|1456|\n",
    "\n",
    "In this list, the two entries that sum to 2020 are 1721 and 299. Multiplying them together produces 1721 * 299 = 514579, so the correct answer is 514579. Of course, your expense report is much larger. Find the two entries that sum to 2020; what do you get if you multiply them together?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:*\n",
    "I initially thought of getting my list of numbers by requesting the information from the advent calendar of code itself, until I realized that it required me to be logged in to get the unique list. Instead this project will use a hard coded version of the number list. "
