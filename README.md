# Advent of Code 2020
The Advent of Code is an annual advent calendar of coding tasks. Kind of a fun little coding problem, akin to the tiny little chocolates one might get in a typical advent calendar. Information about the Advent of Code can be found on the [official website](https://adventofcode.com/)

This repo will have the code I wrote in python using jupyter notebooks for each of the days.

I also set up this repo to track my commits with [#lolcommits](https://github.com/lolcommits/lolcommits) feel free to follow along on [twitter](https://twitter.com/amandacommits) since I configured it to take a snap of me with every commit on this repo (and some others).
